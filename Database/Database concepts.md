#### Schema
``` 
The database schema is the structure of a database described in a formal language supported by the database management system
(DBMS). The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into
database tables in the case of relational databases). The formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas (sentences)
called integrity constraints imposed on a database.[citation needed] These integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts
of the schema. All constraints are expressible in the same language. A database can be considered a structure in realization of the
database language.[1] The states of a created conceptual schema are transformed into an explicit mapping, the database schema. This
describes how real-world entities are modeled in the database.
